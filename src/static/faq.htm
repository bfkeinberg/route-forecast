    <li><strong>What's it about</strong></li>
    <ul>
        The purpose of randoplan is to help you prepare for a bike ride (or a hike I guess) with a known route.
    </ul>
    <li><strong>How do I get routes in</strong></li>
    <ul>
        There are lots of ways. You can type in the route id of a route from Ride With GPS or paste the url from
        their web site. You can do the same with routes from Strava if you pick the Strava input from the selector
        up top. You can click pin on the route on the Ride With GPS page and then click the Use Pinned Routes button,
        after you log in once to their site, you'll then get a menu of all of your pinned routes, which you can pick from.
        If you're a randonneur and riding a permanent route you can move the slider over to RUSA and enter the id of the
        permanent route.
        And if you install the browser extension, on Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, you can click on the extension icon
        from your browser toolbar when you are viewing the web page for a route, and it will bring up a web page
        with <em>Randoplan</em> having loaded the route, ready for you to make a forecast.
        This also works on the iPhone with Safari browser, but it is easier on the iPhone to install the extension
        from the App Store, and then click share in the Ride with GPS or Strava apps when viewing a route in them,
        and one of the share options will be <em>randoplan</em>.
    </ul>
    <li><strong>What are the buttons over the forecast table</strong></li>
    <ul>
        These let us switch what certain columns display. For example, the temperature column can switch to showing
        the 'feels like' temperature, and the wind column can switch to show gust speed instead of wind speed.
    </ul>
    <li><strong>What's the forecast interval for?</strong></li>
    <ul>
        That's how often it will look for a weather forecast. It defaults to one hour because most of the weather 
        forecast services only offer one hour forecasts, but a few of them have the options for more frequent forecasts,
        and some people would like to see the more granular data where available. Note that some of the sources
        (e.g. Tomorrow.io) aggressively limit how often I can get a forecast from their site, so don't be surprised to get
        an error message back when choosing that and using them.
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Speaking of that, why the choice of weather forecast providers</strong></li>
    <ul>
        At this time there's no clear answer as to which of any of those sources of weather information that I have
        available is the most accurate, or is more accurate in one region than another. For that reason I have supported
        those which I have access to and which have the capabilities to be used by randoplan.
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Why don't you support [xyzq] weather forecast provider</strong></li>
    <ul>
        In order to be used by randoplan, a forecast source has to meet serveral requirements. There has to be an web API which
        <em>randoplan</em> can call, and which allows requesting forecasts for a specified time and latitude/longitude coordinates.
        Many do not or only offer forecasts, for say, the entire current day. Also, they can't charge $$$ for their 
        service. Many of these providers are only available when paying hefty monthly bills in advance.
    </ul>
    <li><strong>What do the different colors for wind speed mean</strong></li>
    <ul>
        So, when the wind is from behind, I color that blue. When it's a headwind, if it's less than 10mph, it's colored
        orange, and more than that is red. Similarly for the time lost to wind, only in that case if the maximum wind 
        gust is more than 25mph, it becomes red.
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Why does the map highlight when mousing over the table but only sometimes</strong></li>
    <ul>
        Some routes are missing the data needed to do that highlighting.
    </ul>
    <li><strong>What is a custom segment</strong></li>
    <ul>This lets you get the forecast for a section of the route, making it easier to see</ul>
    <li><strong>Tricks</strong></li>
    <ul>If you have the forecast for a regularly scheduled ride, you can click the calendar icon and it will update
        the start day with the current day.
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Only some of the rest stops or controls in my route are showing up in the list in randoplan</strong></li>
    <ul>Out of caution, <em>randoplan</em> won't extract controls if there are already some in the list. Delete the controls in the list and reload the route.
    All of them should appear now.</ul>
    <li><strong>Why does changing weather provider change the number of days I can forecast</strong></li>
    <ul>Different providers offer different numbers of days in the future to give (at least) hourly forecasts.
        Some offer daily forecasts further out but that is not useful for our purposes.
    </ul>
    <li><strong>why is the wind speed boldfaced with a red background?</strong></li>
    <ul>This is to indicate a crosswind more than 10mph</ul>
