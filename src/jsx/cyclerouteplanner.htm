<h1>Cycle Route Forecast</h1>
<p>Cycle Route Forecast integrates route and elevation data entered from  a GPX file or a Ride With GPS route with a localized Dark Sky weather forecast for the chosen starting date and time and expected riding pace (moving average in mph or km, set with "Metric" checkbox). The route map and a detailed weather forecast for the route will be displayed. <i>Note: route map may not display correctly on a smart phone</i></p>

<h3>Metric Units</h3>
<p>Metric checkbox switches <ul>
<li>Weather forecast temperature between degrees F and C</li>
<li>Weather forecast distance between miles and km</li>
<li>Weather forecast wind and wind gust speed between mph and km/h</li>
<li>Speed in the Pace select list between miles and km</li>
<li>Distances for control points added to the control point list between miles and km</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>
<p>Time, distance along the route at that time, temperature, chance of rain, cloud cover and wind speed and direction are listed, along with expected finishing time and anticipated time gained or lost due to wind.  Wind direction is also shown graphically on the route map.</p>
<p>Clicking on the temperature column heading switches between actual and apparent  temperature, and clicking on the wind speed column heading switches between sustained wind speed and speed of wind gusts.</p>

<h3>Control Points</h3>
<p>Rest stops or control points along the route can be added in the Control Point List, along with the estimated time expected to be spent at those stops. Control points can be added in any order and sorted into proper sequence by clicking on the miles/km column header in the control point list. Expected arrival time at each control point is listed.  If "Display Banked Time" checkbox is selected, time remaining to stay within ACP/RUSA brevet finishing times is listed. </p>

<h3>Post-ride Analysis</h3>
<p>A generated short URL lets the current settings be recreated. Entering Strava data (uploaded by clicking on the “Powered by Strava” control) after the ride will compare actual performance on the ride with the plan.</p>


<h3>Printing the Forecast</h3>
<p>The forecast and control point table can be printed – in landscape mode, portrait won't display all the data correctly – for use while riding the route.  It may be necessary to adjust the width of the screen sections and to use Print Preview to scale the size of the printed page to get everything to fit.</p>
<h3>Reporting Bugs</h3>
<p>A control is provided so that bug reports can be submitted on GitHub.</p>
